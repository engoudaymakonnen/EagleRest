               “I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:
                 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.”

        We have walked through the swamps of failure and burnout and been sustained and transformed by the grace of God.
        We love helping others form a strategic God-led plan for mining treasures out of darkness so that the enemy is overcome instead of them.
